# Atlas API Post-ticketing

**Do we get notified when there is a change in flight schedule for our customers?**

Sometimes airlines can make changes to their flight schedule. These changes range from minor changes in flight schedules to major ones such as cancellation or rerouting.
In this case, the airline will send the message to the contact email or contact mobile of this booking which you sent in the booking request.


**How is the post ticketing process being handled?**

Atlas API supports the post-ticketing process. The API allows for post ticketing functions such as purchasing ancillary services, cancellation requests and processing refunds. Please refer to the API Reference section for further information. You can also reach out to our API support team or the Customer Service Centre to initiate any post-ticketing queries.
